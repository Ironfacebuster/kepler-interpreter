## Welcome to Kepler!
This is my first ever attempt at creating my own language, and was done with little to no research beforehand (for better or for worse). While I'm sure my experience in languages like JavaScript, Python, and C# have influenced the syntax, I tried to make it as original as possible.

### What is Kepler?
Kepler is an interpreted coding language, designed to have very similar grammar as English. This language is mostly intended for beginners to aid in understanding syntax, layout, and other general programming ideas.

### Why interpretation?
Interpretation allows for faster prototyping and development. There's no having to wait for those pesky build times!

### How do I install it?
If you're using **Windows**, follow these steps:
1. Get the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/Ironfacebuster/kepler-interpreter/releases)
2. Run the installer.
3. Restart any already open command prompts.
4. Enter `kepler` into a fresh command prompt!

### Todo List
- [x] Better and more verbose error messages
- [x] Functions returning values
- [ ] Improved function declaration
- [x] Conditional statements (if, else)
- [x] Breakable infinite loops.
- [x] Better (and working) example files

#### **Additionally**, when running the interpreter, you can use provide a path to a `.kep` file, or the `--help` argument to display all arguments.
